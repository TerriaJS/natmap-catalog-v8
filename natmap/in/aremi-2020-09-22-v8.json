Data mapped is for the relevant critical peak season (summer or winter) at each Zone Substation. Where a constraint occurs in both seasons, the season with the largest capacity shortfall over the time horizon is mapped.</p><p>This map allows the user to see the progression of load growth relative to distribution zone substation capacity over time, and understand areas of emerging capacity-related constraint. Note that capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the zone substation and as such this map provides an indicative ‘slice’ of the capacity situation through one level of the network. Also note that these images show available capacity before network or non-network options are taken to alleviate constraints, and before load transfer capability between adjacent zones have been taken into account.</p><p>This map does NOT show:</p><ul><li>Areas facing power outage</li><li>The capacity of the network to accept the connection of embedded or distributed generators</li></ul><p>The green and yellow colours indicate a period when zones that have sufficient spare capacity (available capacity is around or above zero), while the orange and red colours (where available capacity is below zero) indicate periods where zones facing capacity-related constraints where investment will be needed to ensure reliability is maintained.</p><p>Polygons shown are approximate Zone Substation service regions. Clicking on a specific region will reveal the details of that location and time period, including the season of constraint and the exact available capacity value for each year.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution zone substation region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul><li><strong>Asset Type:</strong> Type of the network asset. Data presented in this layer is generally only for the Distribution Zone Substation level, although some businesses have smaller distribution feeder regions represented at times. These assets carry the following definitions:</p><ul><li><strong>Distribution Zone Substation (ZS):</strong> Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers.</li><li><strong>Distribution Feeder (DF):</strong> Medium or high voltage feeder (e.g. 22 kV or 11 kV) emerging from the ZS to distribute power to downstream smaller, local distribution substations.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.</li><li><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional information on the asset or investment.</li><li><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</li><li><strong>Average demand growth rate (MVA/yr):</strong> Average demand growth rate for the asset over the 10-year horizon.</li><li><strong>Data Currency:</strong> The most recent update of the shown data.</li><li><strong>Next update:</strong> The expected date and source of the next update to the data.</li></ul><p>The table and chart shows the available capacity at the selected zone over the next ten years in MVA. Where 2025 data is shown for a <em>winter critical</em> asset, this is for the winter occurring in the middle of 2025. Where 2025 data (for example) is shown for a <em>summer critical asset</em>, this is for the summer season bridging 2024/25.</p>"

This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.</p><p>Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done. <strong>Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.</strong> Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels.</p><p>Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (&gt;$400/kVA/yr).</p><p>Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required.</p><p>Note that where 2025 data (for example) is shown for a <em>winter critical</em> asset, this is for the winter occurring in the middle of 2025. Where 2025 data is shown for a <em>summer critical</em> asset, this is for the summer season bridging 2024/25.</p><p>From the investment year onwards the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

However, the peak demand of a network asset generally occurs only a few hours a year and hence it is useful to show the timing and magnitude of the constrained hours on a representative the peak day.</p><p>This map layer shows the load as percentage of asset capacity for each hour of a representative peak day in the lowest level of the network each area with potentially deferrable investment. For example, if the zone substation has deferrable value then the zone exceedance situation is mapped, while if the only deferrable value is at the transmission level, the transmission exceedance situation is mapped.</p><p>A value &lt; 100% represents spare capacity, while a value &gt; 100% represents an exceedance.</p><p>Note that the critical season (summer or winter) and year of investment is different for each constraint area. As such, the peak day data mapped for each area is for the planned investment year* and the relevant peak season. This means that winter peaking zones may be more likely to show exceedance early and late in the day, and summer peaking zones to show value during the middle of the day and afternoon.</p><p>In the additional information (when a polygon is clicked), the values are graphed to show the peak day load trace.</p><p>* If the first year that support is required is after the investment year, then the exceedance for this year is mapped.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

Each NSP can assist proponents to make informed investment decisions by providing more detailed and project-specific capacity and congestion information as part of a connection enquiry. Each NSP encourages interested parties to contact the appropriate Business Development or Connections team by using the contact details listed in the detailed information for each asset. </p><p>Interested parties are also encouraged to refer to the Transmission Annual Planning Report for each NSP, which provides additional information relevant to the development of new generation projects.</p><p>This is a map of ‘Indicative capacity for new generator connections’ determined according to each Network Service Provider’s (NSP) assessment of available capacity. Where possible, NSPs have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.</p><p>Substations and line assets are mapped and consistently colour coded according to their indicative megawatt (MW) capacity for connection.</p><p>The grey tranmission line underlay has been adapted for visual appearance consistency with the maps of 'New generation connection capacity' by Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) as part of the 'Network Opportunity' maps. The original dataset was obtained from Geoscience Australia, ©Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia) 2015.

These are generally not considered prospective areas for new generator connections, and may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p><p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p><p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p><p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p><p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p><p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p><p>An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Asset name:</b> Full asset name used by the Network Service Provider.  </li>  <li>    <b>Owner:</b> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.  </li>  <li>    <b>Asset Type:</b> Type of the network asset.

As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>The SSHO data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data."

The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics.

WAsP is an industry standard microscale model that was developed for the creating of the European Wind Atlas (Troen and Petersen, 1989).<p>WAsP LIB files contain generalised climate wind statistics which are expressed as wind speed and wind direction frequency distributions for standard heights and surface roughness lengths. The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics.

WAsP is an industry standard microscale model that was developed for the creating of the European Wind Atlas (Troen and Petersen, 1989).<p>WAsP LIB files contain generalised climate wind statistics which are expressed as wind speed and wind direction frequency distributions for standard heights and surface roughness lengths. The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics. This was performed using the Danish Technical University (DTU) Generalized Wind Climate software package. The label of each LIB file gives the latitude and longitude (WGS84 datum) location of the 5 km resolution grid cell result which was used to generate the LIB file, as outlined in the example below.<em>Australia_5km_9.856S_142.310E.lib</em>Each LIB file contains the wind speed frequency distribution, as Weibull-A and Weibull-k parameters, for 12 directional sectors, 5 roughness classes and 5 standard heights.

Only those sub-sectors that are significant organic waste generators within the Manufacturing division have been considered. This has been informed through desktop research and targeted consultation to understand the nature and availability of organic wastes produced, including the location of facilities, production size and subsequent residue generation. This includes the following:<ul><li>Cattle processing</li><li>Pork processing</li><li>Chicken processing</li><li>Dairy product processing</li><li>Wine production</li></ul><p>To determine the locations of major facilities at Local Government Area (LGA) level, the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) databases were utilised. The NPI Guide Version 6.1, September 2015 provides the overarching requirements for industries and threshold trigger requirements. Most of the facilities within the scope of this assessment produce high strength wastewaters with high nitrogen and phosphorus loadings, which is a trigger that will see their inclusion on the NPI list. Industry-wide generation rates for relevant organic waste streams were derived based on the number of employees, desktop research and consultation with industry.</p><p>Only those facilities that trigger the requirement for NPI reporting were included.  These were large facilities producing significant quantities of wastewater i.e. organisations employing 200 + staff or large industrial facilities. There is a gap around facilities operated by Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which employ between 20 to 199 staff. This gap has been identified where possible, addressed where enough information has been available, or highlighted as an area of potential further analysis as part of the continuation of this project.</p><p>The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.</p><p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au.</p><p>If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.</p>",

Only those sub-sectors that are significant organic waste generators within the Manufacturing division have been considered. This has been informed through desktop research and targeted consultation to understand the nature and availability of organic wastes produced, including the location of facilities, production size and subsequent residue generation. This includes the following:<ul><li>Cattle processing</li><li>Pork processing</li><li>Chicken processing</li><li>Dairy product processing</li><li>Wine production</li></ul><p>To determine the locations of major facilities at Local Government Area (LGA) level, the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) databases were utilised. The NPI Guide Version 6.1, September 2015 provides the overarching requirements for industries and threshold trigger requirements. Most of the facilities within the scope of this assessment produce high strength wastewaters with high nitrogen and phosphorus loadings, which is a trigger that will see their inclusion on the NPI list. Industry-wide generation rates for relevant organic waste streams were derived based on the number of employees, desktop research and consultation with industry.</p><p>Only those facilities that trigger the requirement for NPI reporting were included.  These were large facilities producing significant quantities of wastewater i.e. organisations employing 200 + staff or large industrial facilities. There is a gap around facilities operated by Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which employ between 20 to 199 staff. This gap has been identified where possible, addressed where enough information has been available, or highlighted as an area of potential further analysis as part of the continuation of this project.</p><p>The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.</p><p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au.</p><p>If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.</p>",

The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organic waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.

                      "content": "The data presented for Victoria in AREMI are the results of modelling the quantities of biomass residue generated throughout the state across Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and several industries in the Commercial and Industrial (C&I) and Construction and Demolition (C&D) sectors. <p> Data for all modelled residue generation has been presented at a Local Government Area (LGA) equivalent. Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

                      "content": "The data presented for Victoria in AREMI are the results of modelling the quantities of biomass residue generated throughout the state across Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and several industries in the Commercial and Industrial (C&I) and Construction and Demolition (C&D) sectors. <p> Data for all modelled residue generation has been presented at a Local Government Area (LGA) equivalent. Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Grape marc volumes from crushed grapes can vary greatly, and a range of13 – 35% has been cited in the literature.  For this data we have used a conversion factor of 20% wet weight based on the following publications (Corbin et al., 2015; Ky and Teissedre, 2015; Mazza and Francis, 1995).<br>Crushed grape volumes are reported in broad categories and as a result volumes of grape marc that are actually produced may vary from what is reported. However, data should give a good indication of what is available at each location.<br>References:<br><ol>    <li>Corbin, K.R., Hsieh, Y.S.Y., Betts, N.S., Byrt, C.S., Henderson, M., Stork, J., DeBolt, S., Fincher, G.B.,</li>    <li>Mazza, G., Francis, F.J., 1995.

This is about one hundred times greater than required to support a 100% global renewable electricity system. Brownfield sites (existing reservoirs, old mining sites) will be included in a future analysis.</p>This information has been developed by the 100% Renewable Energy group from the Research School of Electrical, Energy and Materials Engineering at the Australia National University.  http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au<p>Potential sites for off-river PHES are identified using GIS algorithms with defined search criteria. The surveyed latitude range is up to 60 degrees north and south. Each identified site comprises an upper and lower reservoir pair plus a hypothetical tunnel route between the reservoirs, and includes data such as latitude, longitude, altitude, head, slope, water volume, water area, rock volume, dam wall length, water/rock ratio, energy storage potential and approximate relative cost (categories A-E).</p><p>Wall heights are adjusted for each reservoir in a pair to yield equal water volumes to achieve the targeted energy storage. Energy (= head * usable volume * g * efficiency) and storage-length combinations are provided in Table 1. The approximate number of people that a reservoirs could service for a 100% renewable electricity grid is listed in the third line.</p><style>  table, th, td {    border: 1px solid black;    padding: 5px;    text-align: center;  }</style><center><table>  <tr>    <th>Table 1</th> <th>2 GWh</th> <th>5 GWh</th> <th>15 GWh</th> <th>50 GWh</th> <th>150 GWh</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <th>6 hours</th> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>-</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <th>18 hours</th> <td>-</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td> <td>✓</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <th>Millions of people</th> <td>0.1</td> <td>0.25</td> <td>0.75</td> <td>2.5</td> <td>7.5</td>  </tr></table></center><p>Virtually all upper reservoirs are away from rivers, and none intrude on protected area or urban areas listed in the databases that we use below.  There may be local constraints that prevent use of a particular site that is not reflected in these databases. Please refer to the ANU 100% Renewable Energy website for additional information: http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global</p><h4>DISCLAIMER</h4>None of the PHES sites discussed in this study have been the subject of geological, hydrological, environmental, heritage and other studies, and it is not known whether any particular site would be suitable. The commercial feasibility of developing these sites is unknown. As with all major engineering projects, diligent attention to quality assurance would be required for safety and efficacy.<p>There has been no investigation of land tenure apart from exclusion of some environmental areas and urban areas, and no discussions with land owners and managers. Nothing in this list of potential site locations implies any rights for development of these locations. Accuracy of the sites depends on the accuracy of the source data. There may be sites that fall into local protected areas or urban areas that are not identified by the source data.</p>",

The Atlas provides interactive maps of wave and tidal energy resources for Australia’s marine estate, with further available information on supporting infrastructure and spatial constraints in the marine domain. The Atlas compiles output from several projects. Notably the CSIRO led Australian Wave Energy Atlas Project, and the University of Tasmania led Australian Tidal Energy (AUSTEn) project, both supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), building on prior CSIRO assessments of Australia's marine energy resources. The Atlas makes it easier to assess the feasibility of potential marine energy projects. The online Atlas has used data from weather mapping, satellites, in-situ measuring stations and a variety of other sources, which have supported development of marine and hydrodynamic modelling applications.</p><p>The online Atlas has 3 main components:<ol><li>Multiple use layers - which contains geographic information on other uses of the marine domain, including supporting, complementary and potentially competing requirements (e.g., Ports, Shipping and Fishing information);</li><li>Wave Energy Resource - includes geographic layers reflecting characteristics of Australia’s wave energy resource, and analysis tools for further data interrogation;</li><li>Tidal Energy Resource - includes geographic layers reflecting characteristics of Australia’s tidal energy resource, and analysis tools for further data interrogation.</li></ol></p><p>The analysis tools of the Australian Marine Energy Atlas provides unique functionality in AREMI.

The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:<p><a href='https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/'>https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/</a><p>The aremi-tmy tool will be used to generate Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data. As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>The SSHO data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data."

              "content": "The Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data is a derivative created by AREMI and based on the Bureau of Meteorology One Minute Solar data. The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:<p><a href='https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/'>https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/</a><p>As part of the processing an intermediate more complete timeseries output is created, referred to as the Solar Station Historical Observation (SSHO) data, which is also available on AREMI. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>After the One Minute Solar data has been processed into the SSHO timeseries, further processing takes place to analyse the separate months of timeseries data to determine the &quot;most typical&quot; months. This analysis is based on the Sandia Method as detailed by S. Wilcox and W. Marion in <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf'>'Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets', NREL</a>.<p>In order to generate a TMY for a station it is a requirement that at least one of the calendar months has data from at least 9 different years.<p>The TMY data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data."
